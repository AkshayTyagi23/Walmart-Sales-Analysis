# Walmart-Sales-Analysis


1. Project Summary
   This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) investigates Walmart’s sales performance across 45 stores in the U.S., spanning from February 2010 to October 2012. Using Python, Pandas,           Seaborn, and Matplotlib, the project unearths patterns in weekly sales, holiday impacts, macroeconomic indicators, and seasonal trends to better understand what drives store            performance.

2. Problem Statement
   Walmart aims to optimize store performance and marketing strategies by analyzing historical sales data. The core objective is to:
   - Identify top and underperforming stores.
   - Understand the influence of holidays, temperature, and economic indicators.
   - Recognize seasonal sales trends. This insight can help with stock planning, targeted promotions, and operational adjustments.

3. How This Analysis Supports Business Objectives
   Strategic Stocking: Prioritize inventory in top-performing stores and around peak months (e.g., December).
   Targeted Marketing: Non-holiday weeks with high variance may hold untapped potential for promotions.
   Store-Level Optimization: Underperforming stores (like Store 33, 44) should be investigated—issues might be operational, demographic, or competitive.
   Holiday Planning: Reconsider blanket holiday sales strategies; not all yield proportional results.

4. Conclusion
   This EDA unveils crucial patterns and uncovers which stores and time periods drive Walmart's revenue. While seasonal spikes and store-based disparities are evident, macroeconomic       variables like CPI and unemployment had limited direct impact. For future growth, Walmart could focus on tailored regional strategies, refining holiday campaigns, and supporting        weaker stores through localized planning. A more granular demographic overlay might further enhance this analysis.
